    If you’ve made it this far, you’re probably curious about who I am. 
    Aside from a mild obsession with Neo-brutalist design, there’s not much that stands out or so I’d like to think. I enjoy coding and tackling tough problems, even if it gets a bit frustrating up the wall sometimes. It’s all part of the fun.
    
    Feel free to <span class="font-bold"><a href="/contact-me">reach out via email</a></span>  I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.</p>

    Nothing much to say here (lol)
